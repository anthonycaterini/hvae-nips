# hvae
This Code to reproduce the experiments in the Hamiltonian Variational 
Auto-Encoder (HVAE) paper (available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11328)).

## Structure

The code is structured into two separate directories:
1. `gaussian` for the Gaussian example
2. `mnist` for the MNIST example

## Requirements

All tests work with Python 3.5.x and 3.6.x (Python 2 functionality not guaranteed). The tests use `tensorflow`, and have been tested with versions 1.3 and 1.8. Other main requirements include `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`.
